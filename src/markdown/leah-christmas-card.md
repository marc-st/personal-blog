## [To Leah,]()

I hope you have had a wonderful and Merry Christmas.

In honour of the 12 Days of Christmas, I have compiled a list of the 12 things I love about you.

### I love,

1 - How you have adopted my sense of humour.

2 - All the different ways you try to make everyone around you happy.

3 - That you listen to me ramble about things I've learned during the day despite not being interested.

4 - How you try your best, and don’t let the life’s inevitable pitfalls bring you down.

5 - That you sing at the top of your voice despite not being a very tal... I'll stop there.

6 - That you care about everyone else more than yourself despite how that can hurt you.

7 - That you put a smile on my face on a daily basis :)

8 - Your smile.

9 - The way you sleep with your mouth open.

10 - How generous and giving you are.

11 - All the things about yourself that you don't.

12 - You.. and only you.
