### Whole by T. Colin Campbell

The plant-based lifestyle has received massive media attention over the past year and for very good reason. Maybe I will write another blog post about veganism more specifically as that is a subject matter I'm really enthusiastic about.

### Learning Unix for OS X by Dave Taylor

I think I would be safe in saying I'm not the only person who owns a Mac and doesn't have a firm grip of the command line. I mean, I'm confident with navigating using cd, the occasional cp or mv, and lots and lots of ls.

A cool book and I learnt a lot, UNIX is so powerful and not as scary as I thought it would be.

### The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down: How to be Calm in a Busy World by Haemin Sunim

Simply put, this book is a hug.

I have noticed a few things from reading the books of Buddhist teachers like Haemin Sunim and Thich Nhat Hanh: They really cut the bullshit.

It is a breathe of fresh-air. Life need not be difficult.

Since reading books similar to this, as well as exploring meditation; life has become beautiful, and simple.
