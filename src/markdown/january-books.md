# Whole by T. Colin Campbell [buy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Whole-Rethinking-Nutrition-Colin-Campbell/dp/1939529840/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1518368348&sr=8-1&keywords=whole)

The plant-based lifestyle has received massive media attention over the past year and for very good reason. Maybe I will write another blog post about veganism more specifically as that is a subject matter I'm really enthusiastic about.
Whole explores how the current paradigm for which we understand nutrition may be fundamentally wrong. Despite being a little full-on, this book made a whole lot of sense to me.

# Learning Unix for OS X by Dave Taylor [buy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Unix-OS-Going-Terminal/dp/1491939982/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518368483&sr=1-7&keywords=learning+os+x)

I think I would be safe in saying I'm not the only person who owns a Mac and doesn't have a firm grip of the command line. I mean, I'm confident with navigating using cd, the occasional cp or mv, and lots and lots of ls.

A cool book and I learnt a lot, UNIX is so powerful and not as scary as I thought it would be.

# The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down: How to be Calm in a Busy World by Haemin Sunim [buy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Only-When-Slow-Down/dp/0241340667/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1518368570&sr=1-1&keywords=the+things+you+can+see+only+when+you+slow+down)

Simply put, this book is a hug.

I have noticed a few things from reading the books of Buddhist teachers like Haemin Sunim and Thich Nhat Hanh: They really cut the bullshit.

It is a breathe of fresh-air. Life need not be difficult.

Ever since reading into Buddhism from these teachers, life has become beautiful, and simple.
