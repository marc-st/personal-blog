### Difficulties with OSS

Open Source is a fantastic way of developing software and has proved to be a very effective way for companies both small and large, to democratise the production of software.
The positive things about OSS stretch far beyond the scope of this article, so in no way do I question it's merit. However I do question it's accessibility for newcomers like me - a CS student keen to contribute my some-what limited experience in software.

The most common framework from which people contribute to open source is GitHub. This is for very good reason, it provides the best interface for collaborating on software, and built off the enormously popular version control system - Git. I use Git for versioning all my projects and GitHub allows me to share my code to everyone that wants to see it (probably not many).

Beyond all this, GitHub is known for the largest open source community of developers, designers and writers - all in one place. It really does seem like a great environment and i'm desperate to get involved.

And here comes my issue. It is very difficult for an entry-level coder to get involved in these projects. Not only that, but repositories are hard to _get a grasp of_ from the outside. I've been reading into ways newcomers can contribute to OS, and it's mentioned that small bug/issues as well as trivial documentation commits are the best way to get your feet wet. But the complexity and nuance of issues are overwhelming, not to be beaten by the fear of completely misunderstanding code and thus writing documentation that doesn't make much sense at all.

I'm sure #most# entry-level developers (Student, New Grad, <1 year experience) would agree with me that open source isn't very accessible - and I'd love to be able to fix that. It is a massive shame because I see a lot of effort has been put into creating contribution guides in repositories for large projects. These contribution guides seem to be great for the people that already have a some-what firm understanding of OSS, and just want a guideline for what they can and can't do, as well as more specific information like branch structure, testing and what code formatting they use.

To end on an optimistic note. It's down to us newcomers, whether you're 13 or 40, to break our way into this amazing community of open source software. By starting together small, building with simplicity and _insert word here_ as a priority, we can jump onto the OSS train, that probably won't stop to let us on...
